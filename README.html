<h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>

<p>I am a proud Greenville resident along with my beautiful wife and daughter. As a creative problem solver, 2020 gave me the opportunity to start a new path in Web Development and I&#8217;m excited to use my skills to help make other people&#8217;s lives better.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d love to have a conversation. Please reach out and let me know where you&#8217;d like to get a drink!</p>
