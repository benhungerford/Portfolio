# Hi! I'm Ben. Nice to meet you.
> Web Developer Greenville, SC

## About Me
I am a proud Greenville resident along with my beautiful wife and daughter. As a creative problem solver, 2020 gave me the opportunity to start a new path in Web Development and I'm excited to use my skills to help make other people's lives better.

I'd love to have a conversation. Please reach out and let me know where you'd like to get a drink!
